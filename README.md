## Tesla Energy Sales

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React Typescript project 

## Commands for development server:

```bash
yarn runApp
# or
npm run runApp
```
After couple of minutes you will find the application running [here](http://localhost:8000).

## Requirements

- The user should be able to enter the number of each device they want, and your UI should show the price, land dimension required and the sites energy density.
- Assume that for every 4 industrial batteries bought 1 transformer is needed.
- The UI should also have an autogenerated layout showing an arrangement of batteries based on the userâ€™s configuration
- The site layouts should not exceed 100ft in width
- If this project requires many things to work, ensure the whole app is runnable with one command.
- Make sure the front-end service runs on http://localhost:8000 when hosted locally

## Software Stack
- React
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Node/Python/Golang

### Adding any one of this is a plus:
